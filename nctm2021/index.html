      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p style="padding-bottom:15px;">
        The figure below depicts a Data Science Process.  
        This process developed as multiple disciplines converged through modeling with data (Chapman 1999, Han 2012 Figure P.1, Schutt 2013 p. 41, Estrellado 2020 Chp. 3, Nantasenamat 2020, Kolter 2021).

            <td class="figtext">  
                                  Roughly, this process involves getting data, cleaning it up, inespecting it, modeling it, and sharing the results. 
                                  This process is not so linear in practice.  
                                  Rather like the engineering design process it can iteratively converge toward a solution.  </td>

      </p>
      
      <p>
        This process is a structure for modeling with data and it is a tool that can incorporate concepts of data science into existing courses.  
        Below is a brief description of the five stages stages. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Data</span> &mdash; <span style="font-style:italic;">Design and Acquire</span><br> 
            The first stage involves getting data.  This might require the design of an experiment or survey, or it could involve simply downloading a dataset.  In any case, we require a <em>data problem</em> and data with which to solve it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Preprocess</span> &mdash; <span style="font-style:italic;">Wrangle and Prepare</span><br> 
          Preprocessing data might be the stage with which students (and teachers) are least familiar, but by many accounts it is where data scientists spend the majority of their time (Kelleher and Tierney 2018, 65-67). 
          Preprocessing involves cleaning up and wrangling data into usable formats.  
          If you have ever combed through a spreadsheet to find cells that interpreted an entry as a date when it wasn't, you have a sense of the preprocessing expereince and how messy it can be.  
          
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Explore</span> &mdash; <span style="font-style:italic;">Visualize and Inspect</span><br> 
        The third stage of Explore almost always involves visualizing data, particularly for the data projects our students work on. 
        In fact, it is not unusual to see this stage called "Visualize".  
        Exploring could also involve analyzing descriptive statistics to familiarize and get a sense of data. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Model</span> &mdash; <span style="font-style:italic;">Model and Validate</span><br> 
        This is the most important stage in some respects. 
        Chances are good that your curriculum documents emphasize this stage and largely ignore the others! 
        A critical component of modeling which is often left out is validation.          
        Validation involves actually checking to verify your model is working.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Communicate</span> &mdash; <span style="font-style:italic;">Communicate and Deploy</span><br> 
        The stage of <em>Communicate</em> could also include "Deploy", <em>i.e.</em>, incorporating a model into a product or implementing a policy decision. 
        While some students hopefully will deploy products they develop, we emphasize communication as the critical component after developing a mathematical model.        
      </p>


        <br>
      <p>
        The Data Science Process is useful as a framework for:
          <ul>
            <li>Conceptualizing the processes of modeling with data</li>
            <li>Scaffolding data projects</li>
            <li>Analyzing data applications</li>
          </ul>
      </p>



      <p>
        The expanded figure below lists some of the components of each stage in the process.  
        This partial list includes steps that students might utilize when working with introductory models. 
      </p>

      <img src="img/dsp-expanded.png">
      <br>
      <table class="figtable">
        <tr>
          <!-- <td class="figlabel">A Data Science Process</td> -->
          <td class="figtext">  
            An expanded view of the Data Science Process.  
            In addition to iterating on these stages, some stages may blend together.
            For example, exploration can easily blend into the modeling stage.  
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        When first introducing the framework, we might scaffold a data modeling project by providing the data, providing explicit walk-throughs of the middle stages, or offering templates for the last stage.
        As students familiarize themselves with the process and we remove scaffolding, we are working toward a point when the students can execute an entire data modeling project from a single prompt.  
      </p>

      <p>
        While the structure is useful and captures an abstraction of what modern data science often looks like, it is just one conceptualization. 
        Projects often don't flow in a linear progression from the first stage to the last.
        For example, after the stage of Explore, we might revisit the stage of Preprocess to do some work we missed. 
        After the stage of Model, we might realize we need to find different features, so we revisit Explore.  
        There can also be a lot of overlap between stages.

      <h3>Example Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The following examples are intended to demonstrate the framing of data projects with the Data Science Process.
        The complete projects are not necessarily presented, but I try to offer enough information that
        you could do these projects or facilitate them with students.

                We notice and wonder about the relationship between the variables we are exploring.             
                Students notice that \(h_p\) appears to have a linear relationship to \(h_i\). 
                They wonder if that relationship continues forever as \(h_i\) increases.
                Some students notice that there are data points which are far away from the others and they wonder if they should revisit their video data.  
                Some students wonder about the bounce-height for a drop-height of zero!

        <h2>Concern</h2>
      </section>
      <p>
        When students are familiar with the Data Science Process, we can leverage its structure to critically analyze data technologies, including those that we are building in class.   
      </p>
      <p>
        When our models are useful, which is to say that they make good predictions, it is important to be able to identify how and why they work as a critical step in anticipating when they will fail. 
        Given the simplicity of most of the models our students will see, this often involves questions of inference and variability. 
        However, students should understand that as their models grow more complex, so do the complications of applying those models, even to the extent that models are not applicable (Birhane 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
        It can be incredibly difficult to identify harm done by technologies, let alone predict or anticipate the source of it in increasingly complex data systems that are interacting with complex social systems, often with multiple feedback loops.  
        In critically analyzing data science products, context is everything and there is no limit of nuance.  
        When we deploy models or products to make or aid in decisions that affect lives, we have a moral obligation to validate and monitor those products to avoid doing harm.  
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Harm from technologies may include, but is not limited to, disproportionate harm done to subpopulations.
        We have seen that historically marginalized populations are often further marginalized by data technologies (Benjamin 2019, Criado-Perez 2020, Eubanks 2019, Wachter-Boettcher 2017). 
        Bias and harm may be incorporated at each stage of the Data Science Process.  
        Assuming we wish to avoid causing harm, we should be conscientious of these issues and pass this understanding on to students who are active consumers and future practitioners of data technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list below contains some of the considerations we may face at each stage of the data science process.  
      </p>        
        
      <p>
      <table style="margin-left:10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%; ">

            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Problematic Problems</span> <br> 
                At the very first step of the process, we translate a problem into a data problem.  
                It is entirely possible that the problem is not one that should be addressed.  
                This could be a value judgment or moral dilemma.  <br> 
                Another issue is presuming a metric in the framing of the problem, <em>e.g.</em>, we want students to do better on a timed test so we ask how do we get students to solve problems faster?
              </li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Harmful Data Collection</span> <br> 
                This can be passive, <em>e.g.</em>, presuming cultural conventions of name formats in a survey. 
                It can also be agressive, manipulating vulnerable populations or violently claiming access.
              </li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biased Data</span> <br> 
                Perhaps the most notorious concern, biased data, <em>e.g.</em>, sampling bias, may lead to poorer outcomes for some.  
                Consider medical studies on primarily men.  
              </li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Privacy</span> <br> 
                There is far too much to say about this bullet.  Remember that time that a fitness bit company released all that customer data and it revealed the locations of military personnel? 
                <br>
                When collecting and working with data, security considerations can be critical.  
              </li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consent</span> <br> 
                Each of us has had data collected about us wihtout our consent.  
                At what point does this cross a line?

                Algorithms do what we tell them to do, not what we want them to do (Shane 2019, Chapter 5).  
                Connecting back to the question we set out to answer at the first stage of the Data Science Process: having the best data about the wrong thing means we aren't modeling what we expected or assumed.  
                We may discover such a disconnect at this stage.

              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Model-Amplified Bias</span> <br> 
                While data may biased, so are models.  This could be due to simple technical issues like getting "stuck" in a local minima, being anchored by initial model training conditions.

                The concept of a feedback loop is used in several fields, <em>e.g.</em>, electrical engineering or control systems, and isn't necessarily harmful.
                Feedback loops lead to harm in data technologies when they amplify bias or exhibit run-away self-reinforcing performance optimization.
                Consider the example of predictive policing: an algorithm tells police where to look for crime, of course police find crime where they look for it, that policing not only has the appearence of affirming the model prediction but reinforces the prediction so they police there more. 
                Even without considering the bias of the data used in the original prediction, it becomes clear that such a system will perpetuate itself by seeming to justify its use until we step back and realize the effect of the feedback loop.

        Many people are working on issues of technology and society, and particularly data technologies.  
        Some years ago there was a flood of media attention to the sudden demand for philosophers in tech. 
        There were any number of articles about the modern-day reformulation of the trolley problem in the context of self-driving cars. 
        Engineers creating self-driving cars are in a situation where they need to decide how a car should respond in an accident before that accident happens.         
        Who is at fault when a self-driving car causes harm?  This is, unfortunately, not hypothetical. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some interesting articles documenting consequences.  
        I kind of want to start collecting them in an organized way.
        Maybe let me know if you'd like that (and like to help)?

        <blockquote>"Our success, happiness, and wellbeing are never fully of our own making. Others' decisions can profoundly affect the course of our lives." <br> &ndash; Barocas et al 2019, Page 1</blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        When we create models trained on data, we are creating optimization problems to maximize or minimize some set of metrics that we have identified as valuable or have let an algorithm identify as valuable. 
        We are encoding values. 
        The extent to which these algorithms might cause harm can be incredibly difficult to predict or even detect, so it is important that we are able to critically analyze methods and applications so as to minimize harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        When handing over the tools of mathematics, we are responsible as educators for teaching their responsible use. 
        It is a sin of omission when we fail to acknowledge the consequences of the content we are teaching. 
        If we are teaching mathematics because it is practical then it is because mathematics is applicable in solving problems, and applied mathematics has consequences. 
        From the problems they choose to solve to the solutions they choose to find through the choices embedded in the processes of modeling, practitioners of mathematics are making decisions that affect us all and we are their educators.

  <div class='session-title'>Opening Session: What We Carry, What We Create: Reimagining Our Legacy in Mathematics Teaching</div>
<div style=padding-left:30px;padding-top:20px;><div>Lateefah Id-Deen<i>Kennesaw State University</i></div></div><br>
  <div>Wed, 10/15: 5:30 PM - 7:00 PM</div>
  <div>Georgia World Congress Center </div>
  <br> 
  <div>This keynote talk is both an invitation and a challenge: to see mathematics teaching as legacy work, where lessons, questions, and everyday interactions leave a lasting imprint, and to reimagine what becomes possible when we teach for content and connection. At the same time, teaching math today requires navigating pressure, uncertainty, and shifting expectations, while still holding space for students to feel seen, heard, and challenged. Lateefah Id-Deen offers a reflective look at what it means to carry purpose into the classroom and to design learning experiences where students' identities are affirmed, their thinking is honored, and joy and belonging are part of the mathematical experience. In this talk, she asks, "What are we really passing on to our students? What do our daily choices make possible for them and for us?" This is a call to teach mathematics with purpose and to build a legacy that lasts.</div>

  <div>Thu, 10/16: 8:00 AM - 9:15 AM</div>
  <div>Room: Intl Ballroom E&nbsp;</div>
<br><div>By the end of Grade 5, students should be able to "classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties." But students are expected to do this based on experiences with static blocks and pictures, and have few opportunities to truly explore the shapes they're expected to classify. We'll use a dynamic tool to notice and wonder about, compare, and match up different quadrilaterals, then discuss how such tools and activities can help students develop their "shape intuition."</div>

  <div>Thu, 10/16: 8:00 AM - 9:15 AM</div>
  <div>Room: None</div>
<br><div>Fractions represent a crucial component of mathematics proficiency, especially in the realm of trades and mathematics for daily life. Helping students develop fraction-measuring skills prepares them for future occupations that require measuring (e.g., construction, food service, and medical fields), and fraction understanding is needed when cooking, making home improvements, and dispensing medication. However, many middle-school students lack fraction-measuring skills. This is especially true for students with mathematics learning disabilities. Our interactive session will present a carefully developed intervention that uses a linear or measurement approach for teaching fraction concepts and skills. The study is part of a larger efficacy study that is testing the impact of an evidence-informed fraction sense intervention tailored for sixth-grade students with MLD. To maximize effectiveness, or, in other words, to help learning "stick" (Brown et al., 2014), the intervention employs general principles derived from research in the science of learning, research in mathematical cognition, and mathematics education. Our intervention is set in the meaningful context of planning for a color run (Bottge et al., 2014). Students construct their own 3-mile racecourse that they separate into fractional portions needed for the race day setup. The number line racecourse is used to develop linear fraction understanding that is then easily transferred to measuring on a ruler and finally the number line. The fraction concepts are taught with familiar denominators commonly encountered in everyday life (halves, fourths, eighths, and thirds), thus avoiding cognitive overload as students think deeply about fraction concepts. The fraction intervention connects familiar representations (e.g., fraction bars) to the number line while emphasizing fraction magnitude, equivalency, and arithmetic concepts. The lessons are presented on animated PowerPoint (APP) slides that allow the lessons to be taught in an authentic sixth-grade math intervention class of as many as 26 students. These slides use integrated visual and verbal models to reduce attention splitting (Ayres & Sweller, 2005). The animations mimic physical movements or gestures to promote learning (Alibali, Nathan, & Fujimore, 2011). Concreteness fading is used throughout the intervention to help students integrate concrete and symbolic representations (Fyfe & Nathan, 2019; Uttal et al., 2013).Multilevel modeling revealed a significant effect of the intervention on the posttest scores of fraction measurement (p</div>

<br><div>Mathematics is often used to control, dehumanize, and categorize. Restor(y)ing mathematics centers a version that reconnects us to each other and the natural world, extending the concept of Indigenous relationality and expanding how we think of mathematics to create new futures. As a theoretical framework, it intervenes by defining mathematics as patterns, structures, and logics between living beings and centers Indigenous storytelling. Restor(y)ing mathematics expands current interpretations and applications of ethnomathematics, with the goal of reconceptualizing mathematics and the patterns we live out with each other as humans and in relation to our more-than-human relatives (lands/waters). In this study, I explore the theory of restor(y)ing mathematics by drawing upon examples from my work with Kanaka Maoli taro farmers in Hawai’i. More specifically, I highlight some of the patterns, structures, and logics that farmers navigate as they enact local innovations to draw waters back to their lands, organize each other, share interdisciplinary knowledge, and reinvigorate Indigenous food systems. Moreover, I offer implications for mathematics education researchers, teachers, and teacher educators who recognize the importance of community-based knowledge and wish to uplift Indigenous knowledge systems.</div>

  <div class='session-title'>Symposium: Catalyzing New Pathways in Mathematics Education through Critical Translanguaging Spaces: Empowering Emergent Multilingual Learners</div>
<div style=padding-left:30px;padding-top:20px;><div>Daniela Tirnovan, <i> University of South Alabama</i></div></div><br>
  <div>Fri, 10/17: 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM</div>
  <div>Room: None</div>
<br><div>This qualitative case study examines the transformative potential of Critical Translanguaging Spaces (CTS) in mathematics education for emergent multilingual learners (EMLs) in second-grade classrooms. As the field evolves to emphasize communication and diversity (Planas & Pimm, 2024), CTS offers a promising approach to address the persistent marginalization of EMLs by bridging their linguistic practices and mathematical learning.Hamann (2018) conceptualized CTS as intentionally designed learning environments where students are encouraged to leverage their entire linguistic repertoire for meaning-making while engaging in critical conversations about language and power. These spaces challenge dominant monolingual ideologies and create more equitable and inclusive classrooms. In mathematics education, CTS can be crucial in validating and building upon students' diverse linguistic and cultural experiences, nurturing positive mathematical identities and empowering them as active contributors to mathematical discourse. Mathematical understanding is deeply rooted in learners' existing knowledge frameworks encompassing their diverse linguistic and cultural experiences. By creating learning environments that validate and build upon these rich backgrounds, educators may nurture positive mathematical identities and empower students as active contributors to mathematical discourse, leveraging their linguistic genius. Drawing on Hamann, 2018, CTS are intentionally designed to facilitate this process, encouraging students to harness their entire linguistic repertoire (Garcia & Wei, 2014)  for meaning-making while critically reflecting on their language practices. This approach challenges prevailing monolingual norms and fosters more inclusive and equitable mathematics classrooms (Hamann, 2018).Grounded in the Translanguaging Structures Framework (TSF) (Tîrnovan, 2023), this study examines societal and systemic structures perpetuating linguistic inequities in elementary mathematics education. Using a qualitative case study design (Yin, 2018) within a larger design-based research project (Barab & Squire, 2004), we analyze classroom interactions, interviews, and student work samples (Saldaña, 2021). Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) of a focal meta-translanguaging conversation reveals that CTS creates linguistic bridges in mathematics classrooms. These spaces empower students' voices and navigate power dynamics between teachers and students as they collaboratively leverage linguistic diversity for math learning (García & Kleifgen, 2020).During the symposium, attendees will learn ways to create CTS to explore learners’ linguistic genius and lived experiences as assets within strategic points of a math lesson engagement. Participants will additionally reflect on the systemic and societal structures inspired by mathematics tasks involving multilingual word problems and collaborative problem-solving. This hands-on activity will demonstrate CTS’s potential in promoting equitable mathematics education. Participants will then reflect on their pedagogical practices and explore ways to cultivate CTS in specific contexts. This research addresses the urgent need to transform mathematics education for diverse 21st-century classrooms (de Araujo et al., 2018). Our findings contribute to emerging research on translanguaging in elementary mathematics (Takeuchi & Esmonde, 2011) and highlight the importance of early intervention in addressing linguistic inequities (Celedón-Pattichis & Turner, 2012). By embracing translanguaging pedagogies, educators can disrupt the marginalization of EMLs and create mathematics learning environments that honor students' linguistic and cultural identities. Ultimately, this research argues that cultivating CTS in elementary mathematics classrooms is not just an educational strategy but a matter of educational justice, preparing EMLs for success in our multilingual world (Flores & García, 2013; Maldonado et al., 2020).</div>

<br><div>Background. As researchers working with teachers, coaches, and administrators, we regularly encounter the laments of both practitioners and academics around “equity work.” We hear teachers say, “I’m not sure where to start” and “How can I support students when I’m white and don’t share students’ culture?” Many teachers are hungry to find ways to support multiply marginalized students (e.g., intersection of race, disability, sexuality), yet do not feel there are tangible ways to do so. We hear academics argue that educators must go beyond intolerance of -isms or admission of privilege and grapple with ways they enact violence against students, families, and communities (Dumas, 2016; Wilderson, 2010). We take up the theories of anti-Blackness (Dumas, 2016) and white supremacy culture (Okun, 2021) to unpack educational practices that create and sustain violence and identify actionable alternatives. Specifically, we support practitioners and academics to engage with the question: What does it mean and what does it look like to center Black girls’ brilliance in mathematics pedagogy? Given that anti-Blackness is one of the most pervasive forms of oppression in the world (Bullock, 2024), and is amplified by gendered discrimination against Black girls (Epstein et al., 2017), focusing on Black girls has the potential to positively impact students and teachers across diverse contexts.Purpose. We offer a pedagogical reflection tool that was developed through an equity audit of an NCTM-aligned secondary mathematics curriculum. Our equity audit transformed the pedagogical framework of Black Feminist Mathematics Pedagogies (BlackFMP, Joseph, 2021) into a qualitative codebook we used to audit the curriculum. BlackFMP is a framework born from studies of Black girls in mathematics classrooms. Building on Critical Race Feminism (Evans-Winters & Love, 2015; Wing, 1997), Black Feminist Thought (Collins, 2022; Leyva, 2021), and intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989), BlackFMP details four dimensions: Academic and Social Integration, Robust Mathematics Identities, Critical Consciousness and Reclamation, and Ambitious Mathematics Instruction. Research Design. We iteratively developed a codebook from BlackFMP (Joseph, 2021) by integrating key ideas from mathematics education research (e.g., positionality, mathematical dispositions, status) and organizing them as codes around the four dimensions of BlackFMP. We then coded 96 lessons from three middle school courses. This coding moved dialectically between deductive and inductive coding (Saldaña, 2021). This dialectic process reduced overlap within and across the four dimensions of BlackFMP, refined the usefulness of codes and their descriptions, and led us to stabilize codes for each dimension. Once the codebook stabilized, we re-coded all prior lessons to ensure consistency. Contribution. This session offers tools and activities for educational praxis (heuristic reflection questions paired with a sandbox of examples) developed from the research-based BlackFMP framework (Joseph, 2021) and corresponding codebook. Our work with teachers indicates these tools are empowering, providing an often elusive starting point. Our work with scholars indicates this work is an important extension of the BlackFMP framework as it provides curricular and pedagogical implications for supporting teachers in centering students’ brilliance in their instruction.</div>

<br><div>Math learning outcomes have continued to reveal differential outcomes for student groups, disadvantaging Black and Latinx students and students experiencing poverty (e.g. Gutiérrez, 2008). Research suggests that there are several factors contributing to these achievement inequities, yet the field has not unlocked the combination which can allow for improved math learning experiences for all students and eradicating disparities in outcomes. More effectively linking research efforts to practice is a necessary step to move us towards this goal. Two possible levers that are highly correlated with mathematics achievement are improving student’s perceptions of mathematics (including but not limited to their math identity) and supporting students’ use of their executive function skills in math contexts. Further, the relationship between these levers has not been systematically interrogated. This proposed symposia session will present the efforts of a coordinated research and development (R&D) program to investigate the hypothesized role of executive function skills and mathematical identity as mechanisms for improving students’ math learning outcomes, as well as the relationship between the two mechanisms. This R&D program consists of three unique teams who each have taken a different approach to designing interventions which embed these levers. These teams have iteratively developed curricular interventions and pedagogical strategies through collaborations across educators, students, developers, and researchers. The teams also systematically test theories in real-world context, while simultaneously studying the impact of their interventions on student learning. The presentations in this symposium will each provide a clear example of how inclusive R&D processes that bring together educators, researchers, and developers can simultaneously develop curricular materials and advance scientific theory regarding an open question in the field. The symposia will begin with an overview of the mechanisms under study across the program and will share about the program’s processes for conducting cycles of research and development. Then, team 1 will discuss the relationship between students’ math identity and math learning outcomes, team 2 will discuss the relationship between executive function skills and math learning outcomes, and team 3 will discuss the relationship between executive function skills and students’ math identity. For each presentation, the team will share how they developed curricular resources based on the research evidence in the field, describe how they have studied the mechanisms through testing their curriculum, and how the gathered evidence has informed continuing development and research efforts. After each presentation, the audience will break into small groups for a discussion activity, where groups are composed of attendees with similar focal areas for their work: (1) teaching and learning, (2) curriculum and assessment development, (3) research on teaching and learning. Groups will discuss: What do these relationships mean for the way I/others teach, design curriculum, or conduct research? How could the examples of teacher practices and curriculum be useful in my own context? Groups will share their takeaways to the full audience, and a “research and practice” agenda will be constructed to represent the collective’s identified next steps and opportunities for collaboration.</div>

In this workshop, we will provide brief introductions to three methods that have been used to engage individuals in reflecting and sharing experiences, discourses, and material interactions that have shaped their mathematics identities. Mathematics education researchers have used autobiographical reflection to uncover particulars of participants' experiences with mathematics. These autobiographical reflections may take on many forms such as an oral interview (e.g., Drake, 2006; Drake et al., 2001), a written essay (e.g., Machalow et al., 2022; McCulloch et al., 2013), and/or a graphical representation of one's mathematics identity (e.g., Anderson, 2005; Bobis et al., 2021; Ingram & Meaney, 2022). All three methods attend to an individual's experiences with mathematics over a period of time. These self-reflection activities, often directed toward mathematics students, mathematics teacher candidates, and/or mathematics teachers, have the goal of greater understanding of mathematics identity (e.g., Bobis et al., 2021; Drake, 2006; Drake et al., 2001; Ingram & Meaney, 2022). Participants in this interactive workshop will engage in brief autobiographical reflections and share their experiences with others. We intend to engage the audience in a discussion around three broad questions: 1) What do we hope math autobiographical reflections do for future and practicing mathematics teachers? 2) In what ways does engaging with the math autobiographical reflections of others inform our understanding of differences in mathematical experiences and identities? 3) How do we think math autobiographical reflections inform teachers' pedagogies and practices?</div>

<br><div>Statistics and data science education is getting more attention in the mathematics education field. Recently, NCTM released statements to urge mathematics educators to incorporate data science concepts into PreK-12 mathematics. As a result, data science curriculum is already being developed and taught in K-12 schools. The Statistical Education of Teachers (SET) report made recommendations for what statistical and data science knowledge PreK-12 teachers should know and how they should learn it. As data science gains popularity as a career path, middle and high school mathematics teachers will need to extend their knowledge of data analysis and statistics to deliver data science concepts in the classroom. The goal of our research project was to iteratively develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-week data science module for PSTs. The learning objectives for this 4-week module include data science content knowledge as well as required mathematical/statistical knowledge for teaching. The purpose of our talk will be to share some of the materials we used to support PSTs’ learning of data science concepts that can also be used by in-service teachers with high school students. The original sequence of lessons that are the focus of this presentation began with classifying a small set of data points to one of two (or more) groups through visual inspection. Then, PSTs considered how a computer program might be coded to do the same classification using an optimization model that relied on projections. Results of the data analysis from year one suggest that, while PSTs did outperform their pre-test scores, the jump from classification through visual inspection to using projections was too large to support PST learning of the module goals. Thus, for year two, the project team revised and developed new lessons to insert after the visual inspection lessons as a scaffold for students that drew upon more familiar mathematical content (Euclidean distance). Results from year two suggest PSTs developed a stronger grasp of the concepts surrounding the use of optimization models for data classification. The goal of this presentation is to share the activities we developed, discuss the effectiveness of these materials on PST learning of data science concepts, and argue that the activities and lessons developed around classification of points using Euclidean distance can also support high school students in learning basic ideas of optimization in data science.</div>

<br><div>The book team behind Promoting Equity in Approximations of Practice for Mathematics Teachers—including the editors, editorial advisory board, and chapter authors—has undertaken a critical examination of how equity can be more intentionally integrated into mathematics teacher education. Approximations of practice, widely recognized as valuable tools, are designed to offer realistic and contextualized environments for developing teaching skills. However, despite their promise, these tools may fall short in addressing issues of equity, leaving a significant gap in preparing educators to engage all students equitably in mathematics. This book positions equity as a central, transformative element in the design and implementation of approximations of practice. By offering a comprehensive analysis of the current state of approximations of practice, the book challenges educators and researchers to rethink the assumptions and frameworks that either foreground or neglect equity. The work is structured into three key sections: the first surveys various approaches to approximations, drawing attention to the lack of focus on equity across many existing models; the second section critically explores the intersection of equity and approximations, promoting dialogue and collaboration between experts in mathematics education and equity researchers; and the third section looks ahead to the future of approximations, envisioning innovative ways to center equity in mathematics teacher education. Collectively, the book team aims to provide educators and researchers with both a critical lens and practical strategies to reimagine approximations as tools for equitable instruction. Through its rigorous exploration of methodology, design, and practice, this book seeks to foster meaningful conversations, inspire shifts in practice, and contribute to the ongoing transformation of mathematics education toward greater equity.</div>

<br><div>Learning trajectories have immense potential to impact the ways in which teachers meet students' needs. However, they have been taken up in deficit ways, using stages or levels at earlier levels of development to classify students as "low." Using the conceptual framework of Brick Wall Learning Trajectories has the potential to decrease the deficit ways in which learning trajectories are taken up by teachers by providing both a strengths-based perspective as well as specific, actionable feedback to teachers. In this qualitative study, we present the case of Isabel, a third grade multilingual student. We explored Isabel's foundational fractions knowledge by engaging her in a clinical wherein she solved seven fractions tasks. Although she only correctly answered 64% of the tasks, she demonstrated 17 different mathematical conceptions. When her conceptions were examined in a data visualization representing the Brick Wall Learning Trajectory framework, her strengths were apparent, as were conceptions that should be explored next in instruction. Data visualizations that align with nonlinear theories of learning trajectories, have the potential to be useful to mathematics teachers, especially those providing small-group or pull-out interventions.</div>

  <div>Room: None</div>
<br><div>In this paper, we present work from an ongoing design research project focused on investigating how to support mathematics teachers in developing critical statistical literacies for doing and teaching statistics. In our work, we leverage the methodological nature of the disciplines of statistics and data science, where data are the key focus of study and to also bring culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) and exploration of sociopolitical issues into the mathematics classroom. The study of data is perfectly suited for CRP because data cannot be investigated without considering context. Critical mathematics scholars have long seen the potential for teaching about data to support critical and culturally relevant pedagogies and more recently, scholars have been considering the use of culturally relevant data in statistics instruction. The specific focus of this proposed workshop will be to present the design of our study and associated learning experiences to support teachers in developing a critical statistical literacy through an investigation on food access. Our study is guided by a set of eight design principles that guide our work in creating a professional learning community (PLC) composed of 18 high school mathematics teachers and their district mathematics specialists. As we describe our project, we will share the design principles and how they support the design of learning experiences in the PLC, which aims to support the mathematics educators’ development of critical statistical literacy to do, and to teach, statistical literacy to their students. As a note, our approach to statistical literacy aligns with the common descriptions of data science in K-12 educational settings. To connect research to practice, we will engage participants of our workshop in one activity we implemented with the PLC teachers during the summer of 2024 to show our design in action. During the winter of 2024, one teacher mentioned in a session that some of her students brought up that some dollar stores in their area were closing and that those were often a source of food and groceries for people in that area. The study of food access and location of grocery stores has been an issue addressed in critical mathematics education-focused lessons in the past and we ask if this was something they would like to dig into themselves. While most lessons focused more on geometry e wanted to dig into the statistical aspects of this issue. The teachers found the topic compelling and spent two days learning about food access in their local communities, exploring data using a dynamic action tool, creating statistical questions, and carrying out data investigations that developed their own critical statistical literacies. They also began to consider how they might incorporate such investigations into their own classroom instruction. We will end our presentation with resources for creating similar learning experiences including the data workspaces for researchers/teachers to explore in their own settings.</div>

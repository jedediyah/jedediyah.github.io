We will examine the pedagogical disconnect that we, as district-level coaches and former teachers, curriculum developers, and mathematics education researchers, have observed between mathematics education research, special education research, and teaching practices in classrooms across 30 districts in the Chicagoland area. Focussing on these coaching dilemmas, we will engage in interactive activities to explore ways that learners make meaning in mathematics and discuss ways to bridge the current divide between research and practice.";

Many people are discouraged from asking these questions in school, thinking they're too simple to be taken seriously, or being told that their questions are stupid. But often, these simple-sounding questions lead to wondrous mathematical revelations. Dr. Cheng will take us on a journey of discovery starting with questions like 'Why does 2×3 = 3×2?' and 'What's the point of math?' leading us into research-level abstract mathematics. The journey will take us via food, music, hairstyles, and other unexpected topics, revealing how profound insights can emerge from seemingly unlikely sources, and showing that being the kid who asked 'But, why does 1+1=2?' could be more important than being the kid who always got the right answers.";

We share our current research collaboration with a school district called Games(Games for Access to Mathematical Engagement). Games Time is a twice-a-week game session where undergraduates and teachers play specially chosen non-digital math games with all students (grades 3 and 4, with a pilot in middle school).  In this session, participants will engage in playing and analyzing games, hearing results of our research, and brainstorming ways to rethinking approaches to intervention in their setting.";

In this presentation I share a case study of one third-grade student with significant learning difficulties who engaged in 51 student-centered grade-level math lessons. Despite experiencing difficulty counting, reading and writing numbers (e.g., 12), and addition within 10 (e.g., 4+1), she engaged in grade-level mathematical problem solving. I will share 11 instructional practices that supported her access and sensemaking.  Participants will watch video excerpts illustrating these practices and reflect together on key instructional decision points.";

Many people are discouraged from asking these questions in school, thinking they're too simple to be taken seriously, or being told that their questions are stupid. But often, these simple-sounding questions lead to wondrous mathematical revelations. Dr. Cheng will take us on a journey of discovery starting with questions like 'Why does 2×3 = 3×2?' and 'What's the point of math?' leading us into research-level abstract mathematics. The journey will take us via food, music, hairstyles, and other unexpected topics, revealing how profound insights can emerge from seemingly unlikely sources, and showing that being the kid who asked 'But, why does 1+1=2?' could be more important than being the kid who always got the right answers.";

The papers reflect a multiplicity of theoretical and methodological uptake of intersectionality to study how systemic oppression is reinforced, disrupted, and navigated.

But often, these simple-sounding questions lead to wondrous mathematical revelations. Dr. Cheng will take us on a journey of discovery starting with questions like 'Why does 2×3 = 3×2?' and 'What's the point of math?' leading us into research-level abstract mathematics. The journey will take us via food, music, hairstyles, and other unexpected topics, revealing how profound insights can emerge from seemingly unlikely sources, and showing that being the kid who asked 'But, why does 1+1=2?' could be more important than being the kid who always got the right answers.";

She was also a well-respected public voice in support of mathematics education through testimony before Congress and in the news media. Carl served as NCTM president from 1990 to 1992. In 1997, she received the Mathematics Education Trust Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of her lifelong commitment to mathematics education.

In this talk Eugenia Cheng will argue that math comes from human curiosity – most importantly, from asking questions. Many people are discouraged from asking these questions in school, thinking they're too simple to be taken seriously, or being told that their questions are stupid. But often, these simple-sounding questions lead to wondrous mathematical revelations. Dr. Cheng will take us on a journey of discovery starting with questions like 'Why does 2×3 = 3×2?' and 'What's the point of math?' leading us into research-level abstract mathematics. The journey will take us via food, music, hairstyles, and other unexpected topics, revealing how profound insights can emerge from seemingly unlikely sources, and showing that being the kid who asked 'But, why does 1+1=2?' could be more important than being the kid who always got the right answers.";

She was also a well-respected public voice in support of mathematics education through testimony before Congress and in the news media. Carl served as NCTM president from 1990 to 1992. In 1997, she received the Mathematics Education Trust Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of her lifelong commitment to mathematics education.

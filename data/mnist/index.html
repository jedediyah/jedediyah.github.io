        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database is a classic in introductory machine learning courses.  
                It contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.  
                Each image is 28x28 pixels.  
                The goal is to be able to algorithmically “recognize” or classify each digit from an image.  
            </p>
            <p>
                While the MNIST database is decades old, character recognition is fundamental to modern data applications.  
                It is used in apps like Photomath for digitizing mathematics problems, and in autonomous vehicles for reading street signs.  
                An understanding of image processing algorithms and their applications can help develop an appreciation for the brittle nature of these algorithms and the critical role they play in a wide variety of sensitive applications. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The following lesson is not on machine learning, rather it invites students to explore data and create algorithms themselves while introducing fundamental ideas in image processing and feature engineering for classification.  
                Students are first asked to conceptualize and formalize features to distinguish 0s from 1s.  
                Then they are invited to distinguish as many digits as they can, either manually or with the help of additional technologies.

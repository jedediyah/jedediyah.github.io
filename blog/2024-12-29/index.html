            The title of this web log, "All Models are Wrong", will be familiar to many. It might sound negative to those unfamiliar with it, but it is not meant to be! It is a reminder of an important principle that is often ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            The title comes from George Box, who is often quoted as saying "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong">all models are wrong, but some are useful</a>". I know this quote from his book with Norman Draper, <em>Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On page 424 of that text, we see the famous quote with additional details.

            That dot equals symbol, \(\dot{=}\), in equation 13.1.3 means "approximately equal". I'm not sure that I had seen this notation before! I have seen the dot used in formal logic to represent negation, and I suppose that "not equal to" is kind of like "approximately equal to". I wonder if it is the same dot.

            Then we see one of my favorite paragraphs in the book on page 425. 
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "Although the above implies that systematic errors \(\boldsymbol\delta(\boldsymbol\xi)\) are always to be expected, there has been, since the time of Gauss (1777-1855), an unfortunate tendency to ignore them, and to concentrate only on the random errors \(\boldsymbol\varepsilon\). This seems to have been because nice mathematical results are possible when this is done. In choosing an experimental design, the ignoring of systematic error is <em>not</em> an innocuous approximation and misleading results may well be obtained, as we shall see in due course."
                </p>

            There is so much to take away from this one section. A lot of good can come from reminding ourselves that all models are wrong. </p>

            I love teaching. Teaching is complicated. A sincere, open-minded, skeptical, critical perspective is valuable in teaching. I think that is related to how or what I want to write about here. Plus pictures of random ass books.
